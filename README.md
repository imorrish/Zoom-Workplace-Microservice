# Zoom-Workplace-Microservice
Rest interface to the Zoom Workplace functionality available in Stream Deck

Not working!!!
Don't know what I'm doing - Vibe coding at its worst.

See the spec.md for what I hope it will do

To test:
To test apps in the workspace client before publishing, enable developer tools by modifying your client configuration. 
Windows: Add webview.context.menu=true to the zoom.us.ini file located in %appdata%/Zoom/data.
Mac: Run defaults write ZoomChat webview.context.menu true in the terminal. 
Note: You must restart the Zoom desktop client for these changes to take effect.
